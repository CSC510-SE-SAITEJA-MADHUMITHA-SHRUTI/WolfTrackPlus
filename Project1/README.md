## What was hard about this process, how could that pain have been avoided, and what practices are you committing to perform in Project 2 to avoid that pain. ##

In the initial phase of our software engineering project, our team encountered a multitude of challenges, ranging from team dynamics to technical execution. To provide a comprehensive perspective on our journey, this discussion will be segmented into two main areas: the Team's Perspective and the Technicalities.

One of the foremost challenges we faced was finding a suitable time for the entire team to convene and review our assigned tasks. This proved to be a formidable task, primarily due to our disparate schedules and heavy academic commitments. Recognizing the inherent advantages of in-person meetings over online ones, we were determined to make them work. After some concerted efforts, we managed to secure a group study space at the library for our team meetings.

Understanding the need for effective coordination, we decided to share regularly updated calendars with each team member. This simple step streamlined our scheduling process and facilitated better alignment. Additionally, we realized the pivotal role that well-structured meetings play in project success. Thus, we have made it a priority to establish clear objectives and deadlines for our future gatherings. In forthcoming sessions, we intend to closely monitor task distribution and assess individual progress, acknowledging the potential benefits of distributed development methodologies, which we plan to embrace in Project 2.

In the realm of technical execution, we embarked on our project by developing the "Teachers Pet Bot." However, our journey was soon fraught with challenges arising from dependencies that were no longer supported as of 2022. While we diligently sought solutions to eliminate these dependencies, the intricate web of interdependencies posed hurdles during code execution. After careful deliberation and communication with the project owners, we decided to pivot our project towards "WolfTrackPlus."

"WolfTrackPlus" serves as comprehensive job-tracking software, offering a wide array of practical features and serving a vital purpose. Nonetheless, we recognize that the project's documentation requires enhancement. At the outset, we grappled with issues related to IAM (Identity and Access Management) users and permissions, which impacted our database connectivity. Furthermore, the guidance provided for setting up the AWS account and the RDS database proved to be insufficient. In Project 2, we are committed to addressing these documentation deficiencies to facilitate the onboarding of potential contributors and streamline project improvements.

Additionally, we observed significant changes in the project structure between versions 1 and 2. To ensure that these adjustments have enhanced the project's quality, we are vigilant about regularly updating our project goals and requirements. This agile approach will enable us to minimize rework and adapt swiftly to evolving project dynamics—a critical asset in an era characterized by rapid change and unpredictability.

Another issue that came to our attention was the unexpected malfunctioning of the hosted website. This unforeseen technical hiccup served as a stark reminder of the need for robust testing and continuous monitoring throughout the project's lifecycle. Addressing this issue promptly and comprehensively will be a priority in our upcoming project phases.

Lastly, we recognized that there is room for improvement in terms of code quality, readability, and organization. In Project 2, our objectives are clear: we aim to refactor the codebase to enhance its clarity, organization, and maintainability. Additionally, we are eager to expand the feature set of "WolfTrackPlus," aligning it more closely with the needs of our users. Our commitment to providing a more efficient and user-friendly application is underpinned by our resolve to include comprehensive comments, which will facilitate not only our own development efforts but also the app's use by others.

The challenges encountered in the first phase of our software engineering project have been invaluable learning experiences. We have diligently addressed issues related to team coordination, technical execution, project documentation, website hosting, and code quality. Looking ahead to Project 2, we are poised to implement the lessons learned, embrace the principles of agility, and work collaboratively to create a more robust, efficient, and user-centric software application. In an environment characterized by change and complexity, the Agile methodology remains our guiding compass, emphasizing flexibility, teamwork, and customer focus as essential drivers of project success across diverse sectors.
